# DCSVersionBackup
Tool to easily backup DCS before an update
Not completed yet, still some work to do...........
Eventually will backup DCS World, DCS folder in saved games, helios & jsgme folders if you have them to a location of your choice.
Only writing it because im too lazy to do it manually for the countless updates we have.
Handy if an error occurs just replace the original folders with the folders you backed up to roll back to the original version
